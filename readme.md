# Hello, I'm Junior Velo Alonso ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a passionate Java Developer who loves to solve problems and build applications that make a difference. My primary expertise lies in working with the Spring Framework, which I find incredibly versatile and powerful for developing enterprise-grade applications. In addition to Java, I also enjoy working with JavaScript backend frameworks. The dynamism and flexibility of JavaScript make it a great tool for backend development, and I love exploring its potential. I also have a keen interest in frontend development. Building user interfaces that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing is something I find deeply satisfying. I believe that a great application is not just about the code that runs in the background, but also about providing a seamless and enjoyable user experience.
I have experience working with on-premise cloud environments and have a deep understanding of complete CI/CD pipelines. This knowledge allows me to ensure efficient and reliable deployment of applications. Recently, I've been diving into the world of public cloud with Azure. I'm excited about the scalability and flexibility that cloud platforms like Azure can offer, and I'm eager to continue expanding my skills in this area.
