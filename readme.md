# Hello, I'm Junior Velo Alonso ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸš€ About Me
Hello, I'm a passionate Java Developer who loves to solve problems and build applications that make a difference. My primary expertise lies in working with the Spring Framework, which I find incredibly versatile and powerful for developing enterprise-grade applications.
In addition to Java, I also enjoy working with JavaScript backend frameworks. The dynamism and flexibility of JavaScript make it a great tool for backend development, and I love exploring its potential.
I also have a keen interest in frontend development. Building user interfaces that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing is something I find deeply satisfying. I believe that a great application is not just about the code that runs in the background, but also about providing a seamless and enjoyable user experience.
